# iEvoBio

This year's theme is "Enabling the next generation of computational biologists." We will have two sessions, morning and afternoon. The morning session will have a round of 12-minute talks from computational evolutionary biologists in various careers (R1 faculty, primarily undergraduate institution faculty, government). They will speak briefly about their research and how it is enabled by computation, and how they balance computational work with the outputs they need to produce in their role. This will be followed by a panel discussion of pre-selected and audience questions about careers in computational evolutionary biology. We will aim to answer the following questions: 

- How have you balanced software development or computation with the outputs you need to be successful in your career?
- How does your position reward, or not reward, software work?
- What does mentoring students and staff mean for your career?
- What are the special challenges for evolutionary biologists who want to have a career like yours?
- What funding sources have been helpful on your career path?


The afternoon session will be an education session focused on helping undergraduate and graduate students learn to effectively use scientific computation. This session will begin with 10-minute contributed talks from the community discussing delivering computational coursework. We will follow this with a Birds of a Feather session aimed at getting instructors serving similar student groups together to discuss syllabi, technical challenges, and assessment. We will aim to answer the following questions:

- What are evolutionary biologists being taught about computation?
- What should evolutionary biologists be taught about computation?
- What are the dominant technologies for serving course content to biologists, and how are they suceeding? How are they failing?

Registration will be $85 for for faculty and professional attendees registering in conjunction with the Evolution meetings. Registration will be $30 for graduate students and postdocs in conjunction with the Evolution meetings.
