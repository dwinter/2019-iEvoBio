# iEvoBio

This year's theme is "Enabling the next generation of computational biologists." We will have two sessions, morning and afternoon. The morning session will have a round of 12-minute talks from computational evolutionary biologists in various careers. They will speak briefly about their research and how it is enabled by computation, and how they balance computational work with the outputs they need to produce in their role. This will be followed by a panel discussion of pre-selected and audience questions about careers in computational evolutionary biology.

The afternoon session will be an education session focused on helping undergraduate and graduate students learn to effectively use scientific computation. This session will begin with 10-minute contributed talks from the community discussing delivering computational coursework. We will follow this with a Birds of a Feather session aimed at getting instructors serving similar student groups together to discuss syllabi, technical challenges, and assessment.

Registration will be $85 for for faculty and professional attendees registering in conjunction with the Evolution meetings ($100 for stand-alone registration). Registration will be $30 for graduate students and postdocs in conjunction with the Evolution meetings ($50 for stand-alone registration).
